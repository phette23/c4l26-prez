<figcaption>Term mapping spreadsheet with colums "V Type", "VAULT value", "V auth", "New Label", "Auth", "Auth URI", and "Status". The sheet shows that terms were of various types (genre, topic, name), came from different sources (local, ULAN), sometimes had their text change ("Comic Memoir" to "Autobiographical comics"), were mapped to various LC vocabularies (LCGFT, LCSH, LCNAF), had LC URIs, and were all of status "done".</figcaption>
