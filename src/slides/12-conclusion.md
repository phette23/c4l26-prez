It is worth revisiting the ideological commitments of organizations that undergird our data and systems. Centralizing around terms controlled by any political entity comes with innate risk, much as dependence on corporate software can be dangerous. In an age where American political parties seem to have lost the will and ability to improve the lives of ordinary people, struggle moves to symbolic arenas. The Gulf of Mexico is unlikely to be the final victim.

No institution is perfect. But some flaws are less likely to influence metadata quality. It is unreasonable to expect community-run efforts to fully substitute over a century of work on the Library of Congress vocabularies. Diversifying, instead of replacing, our authority sources is the most realistic approach.
