        <ul>
            <li>Numerous relevant vocabularies: ULAN (names), AAT (subjects, genres), TGN (places)
            <li>Also well-structured with convenient data features
            <li>Focus on art & architecture is perfect
            <li>We were already using some terms & some are not available in LC
            <li>Register to edit the vocabs; did not get to experiment
        </ul>
