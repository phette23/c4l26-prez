<div class="subtitle">Reliance on LC is, at root, reliance on the US federal government.</div>

<blockquote>
"While recognizing the value of a shared set of terminology, the PCC community’s commitment to DEI principles necessitates a broadening of the perspectives represented in our library catalogs. Libraries have successfully used alternative vocabularies in addition to LCSH for years, and we encourage PCC members to continue to use alternative vocabularies in shared records whenever possible.
<br><strong>In light of this, PCC encourages its member institutions to explore avenues for reducing reliance on a single controlled vocabulary controlled by LC</strong>."
